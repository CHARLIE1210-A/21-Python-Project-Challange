# Number Guessing Game

This is the 2nd project in the "21 Days Python Project Challenge". It's a simple number guessing game implemented in Python, designed to help beginners practice basic programming concepts such as input/output, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## How to Play

- The game randomly selects a secret number based on the chosen difficulty level.
- You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, you'll receive feedback whether your guess is too high or too low.
- Your score is calculated based on the number of attempts left and the difficulty level.

## Difficulty Levels

- **Easy**: Number between 1-10, 5 attempts
- **Medium**: Number between 1-50, 7 attempts
- **Hard**: Number between 1-100, 10 attempts

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Open a terminal in this project directory.
3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
