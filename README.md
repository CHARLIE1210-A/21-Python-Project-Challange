# Python 21 Project Challenge

This repository contains 8 Python projects as part of the "21 Project Challenge". Each project is designed to help you learn and practice core Python concepts, including file handling, OOP, data structures, and more. Below is a brief overview of each project and instructions for running them.

## Projects Overview

1. **Student Management System**
   - Manage student records: add, view, search, update, and delete students.
   - Data is stored in a JSON file for persistence.
   - Demonstrates OOP, file I/O, and basic CRUD operations.

2. **To-Do List Application**
   - Create, view, update, and delete tasks.
   - Tasks are saved locally for future sessions.
   - Practice with lists, dictionaries, and file handling.

3. **Simple Calculator**
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
   - Input validation and error handling included.
   - Reinforces function usage and user input.

4. **Contact Book**
   - Store and manage contact information (name, phone, email).
   - Search and update contacts easily.
   - Focuses on dictionaries and file persistence.

5. **Expense Tracker**
   - Track daily expenses, categorize them, and view summaries.
   - Data stored in a file for analysis.
   - Practice with lists, file I/O, and basic statistics.

6. **Quiz Application**
   - Take quizzes, view scores, and add new questions.
   - Demonstrates use of classes, randomization, and file storage.

7. **Library Management System**
   - Manage books: add, search, issue, and return books.
   - Demonstrates OOP, file handling, and data validation.

8. **Weather App (CLI)**
   - Fetch and display weather information for a given city using an API.
   - Practice with requests, JSON parsing, and error handling.

## How to Run Each Project

1. Open the project folder in VS Code or your preferred IDE.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install any required packages (see each project's requirements.txt if available).
4. Run the main Python file for each project, e.g.:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions for each application.

## Folder Structure

Each project is contained in its own folder with the following structure:

```
project_name/
├── main.py
├── [other modules].py
├── [data files]
├── README.md
```
