# Python Calculator Challenge

This repository contains a simple calculator application built in Python as part of a 21-day coding challenge. The goal of this project is to improve Python programming skills through hands-on practice and experimentation.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Calculation history saved to a text file
- Command-line interface for user interaction

## Files
- `main.py`: The main Python script containing the calculator logic and user interface.
- `calculation_history.txt`: Stores the history of calculations performed during usage.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** to perform calculations and view history.

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- Practice Python programming fundamentals
- Learn file handling and user input
- Build confidence through daily coding exercises

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## License
This project is for educational purposes and personal skill development.
